Overview
Forest Classification Validation Analysis
This script undertakes a validation analysis of forest classification predictions by leveraging classification metrics and confusion matrices. It processes CSV files containing actual and predicted classification data, calculates a suite of validation metrics including F1-score, precision, recall, Cohen's Kappa, AUC, and generates confusion matrices for each classification scenario.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: pandas, sklearn, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, os, time
CSV files with actual and predicted forest classification data

Installation
Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib numpy

Usage
Forest Classification Validation Analysis
1. Reads actual and predicted classification data from CSV files.
2. Filters valid data points for analysis.
3. Calculates validation metrics for each classification category.
4. Generates confusion matrices and saves them as PNG files.
5. Writes a summary of the analysis to a text file including classification metrics for all classes and averages where applicable.

Key Functionalities
Data Processing: Opens CSV files to read actual and predicted class data, performing necessary preprocessing.
Metric Calculation: Utilizes scikit-learn to calculate various classification metrics for individual classes and across the dataset.
Visualization: Generates confusion matrices for each CSV file using seaborn and matplotlib, providing a visual assessment of classification performance.
Summary Output: Compiles an analysis report summarizing classification metrics and saves this report to a text file.

Output
Text File Summary: A detailed report containing F1-scores, precision, recall, Cohen's Kappa, overall accuracy, user and producer accuracy, and AUC for each class, alongside overall metrics for the dataset.
Confusion Matrices: PNG files for each CSV file processed, visualizing the actual versus predicted classifications.

Additional Notes
Before running the script, ensure that csv_folder, output_file_path, and confusion_matrix_folder paths are correctly set according to your directory structure.
The script filters for valid classification data points and assumes a fixed set of class labels (1 through 6). Adjust the range of class labels according to your dataset if necessary.
UndefinedMetricWarning exceptions are suppressed to maintain the readability of the script's output, though you should be mindful of cases where this might mask important issues with the classification data or process.
